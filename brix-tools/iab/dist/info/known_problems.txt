Lucid v1.0.0Beta4 - Known Problems
==================================

***This release is intended for demonstration purposes only***

Windows version does not honour per-pixel alpha channel in the graphics viewport. 
The global alpha value of the viewport is used for all graphics in the view port.

Installing windows tools into using wine on linux hosts results in the file history features failing.

Uploading new applications whilst video is playing results in the runtime crashing (Resolved in v2.0).
